    <p>The &quot;Assemble and Annotate Microbial Genome&quot; app assembles a set of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) short reads into contigs and then performs structural and functional annotation of the assembled contigs, calling genes and assigning biological functions. The user supplies a set of FASTA or FASTQ files with short reads and chooses one of a variety of assembly algorithms. After the assembly, the contigs are automatically annotated by KBase’s annotation pipeline, which includes assignment of biological functions derived from the SEED Subsystems ontology. The resulting annotated genome can be exported in GenBank or FASTA format or used as input to other KBase apps such as &quot;Reconstruct Genome-scale Metabolic Model&quot;.</p>
