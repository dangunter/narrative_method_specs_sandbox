description : |
    <p>This method performs an all-vs-all proteome comparison for a pair of species. The algorithm filters edges in bipartite graph representing hits between genes found by blastp program. Every edge in graph connecting two genes is weighted according to bit-score of blast protein alignment. If some edge has a weight less than certain cutoff ratio (90% by default) of the maximum weight among neighboring edges then this edge is eliminated. Neighboring edge means any edge connecting with given edge in any gene.</p>
    
    <p>The output of this method is visualized as a dot plot matrix showing pairs of similar proteins determined from the BUS algorithm. This dot plot can be navigated by users with the provided zoom and scroll functions. Hovering over colored dots in the dot plot displays information about that pair of proteins. Clicking on a dot displays a column browser mode which allows one to navigate to the next or previous similar proteins in either genome. A larger red dot in the plot indicates the current pair of proteins.</p>
