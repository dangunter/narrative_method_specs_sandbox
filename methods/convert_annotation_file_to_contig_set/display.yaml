    Converts a KBase assembly file object to a set of contigs. Currently
    assembly files are generated when transferring to KBase assembled
    genomes generated by internal pipelines at Joint Genome Institute (JGI).
    An assembly file object is a FASTA file containing the genomic sequence of
    an organism that has been assembled from sequencing reads. The method
    simply converts the assembly file into the KBase contigs data type.
